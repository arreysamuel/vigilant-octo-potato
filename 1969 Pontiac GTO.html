                <h4>1978 Pontiac Firebird - TRANS AM - MAYAN RED</h4>
                <p>This 1969 Pontiac GTO has that â€œWOW'' factor! It wears its factory color, code 59 Limelight Green with black vinyl top. The paint has been color sanded to perfection. It has a nice slick glossy finish and is very straight down both sides with nice fit and finish. The front bumper fits nicely. The front grills are in great condition. It has the desirable hideaway headlights and they work as they should. In the rear, the bumper, tail light bezels and lenses have been replaced. The door handles, emblems, window fuzzies and weather stripping have also been replaced. It rides on a restored set of 14x6 Rally II wheels with new trim rings, center caps and correct lug nuts wrapped with a set of BFG red line radial tires.
                    This GTO has a completely rebuilt date coded WT 400 ci motor, casting number 9790071. The engine is detailed with correct chrome valve covers, functional Ram Air, factory manifolds, a Delco Moraine power brake booster, dual master cylinder, power steering, Harrison 4-core radiator with correct clutch fan and fan shroud. The engine bay is painted and has a nice satin black finish for that original look. Everything is nice and tidy.
                    The black bucket seat interior is in great shape. The seats have new cushions and upholstery. In between the bucket seats is a 4 speed console with correct Hurst 4 speed shifter coming up out of it. The door panels are still in great condition! The headliner is tighter than a drum. The carpet, sill plates and kick panels have been replaced. The dash pad is in good shape with no signs of any cracks. Looking forward at the gauge cluster, it has the optional Rally gauges with a factory hood tach. The lenses are clear and they all function like they should. The power windows all go up and down with ease. It retains its factory wood sport steering wheel and has a tilt steering column!
                    The underside is all clean metal. The bottom of the engine is clean along with the Muncie 4 speed transmission. It has a dual exhaust system that runs all the way out the back with correct chrome tips. The front suspension is all new along with all 4 shocks, springs and front disc brakes. It has a new gas tank, sending unit and straps. The fuel and brake lines are all in good condition as well. The E-brake is all hooked up and working!
                    The trunk is detailed nicely with factory splatter paint, a spare tire and jack assembly with lug wrench. The trunk mat and weather stripping have been replaced.
                    This GTO is a real eye catcher! It's clean, sexy and unabused with great features!!</p>
